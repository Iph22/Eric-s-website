                    </p>

                        Demonstrating strong leadership abilities early in his career, Mr. Darko served as School
                        Prefect from 2000 to 2001. His coaching career
                        encompasses significant roles, including his tenure at Royalties Sports Academy from January 6,
                        2014, to January 7, 2017, where he functioned
                        as the Director of Physical Education. He began his coaching journey as an Assistant Basketball
                        Coach at Presbyterian Boys Secondary School in Legon.
                        Before he engaged with Royalties Sports Academy, he was persuaded by Mike Davies to join the
                        institution after achieving a second-place finish
                        in the Sprite Ball Basketball Championship. Furthermore, Mr. Darko coached Galaxy International
                        School to a third-place finish at the Independent

                        Tournament. He has also organized various basketball camps
                        for different age groups and has trained some of the most talented basketball players in the
                        nation.
